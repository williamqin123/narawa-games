				"It's 7:00 in the morning, right before school. How would you like to start the day? <div class='choice' data-effect='1'>Walk around in the hallways until class starts.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='2'>Run outside the school and onto the streets to escape.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='3'>Talk to your friends at the lockers as usual.</div>",
				"You walk around the school in the hallways before class starts. Suddenly, you encounter Max the bully. What do you do? <div class='choice' data-effect='4'>Fight off Max.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='4'>Run away from Max.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='4'>Ignore Max, because it's not worth getting involved with a bully.</div>",
				"You try to push open the front door of the school, but it's locked from the inside. People can't go out of the school, but people can come into the school. So, do you want to wait until someone opens the door from the outside?  <div class='choice' data-effect='5'>Yes.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='6'>No, because I'm impatient.</div>",
				"You walk over to the lockers and wait for your friends to come by next to you. But it's not your friend who comes by you first. It's Max the bully! What do you do? <div class='choice' data-effect='4'>Fight off Max.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='4'>Run away from Max.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='7'>Wait for your friends to come and help you.</div>",
				"Too bad, because Max punches you in the face before you can do anything else. And too bad again, because you fall to the ground. And double too bad, because you died.",
				"You wait for someone to open the door. Soon, a group of girls open the door from the outside and walk inside the school. Would you like to run outside before the door closes, or would you like to trip over the girls because you're an idiot and you like to pull pranks on innocent people? <div class='choice' data-effect='8'>Escape the school.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='9'>Trip them over.</div>",
				"You decide not to wait until someone opens the door from the outside, so what do you want to do? <div class='choice' data-effect='10'>Pick the door lock with a paper clip.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='11'>Give up on escaping, and go to class.</div>",
				"You wait for your friends to come by the lockers, hoping that Max won't beat you up. And surprisingly, Max doesn't even see you! He just walks past you. That's great and all, but the bell rings. You're late for class, and your friends didn't even come by your locker! <div class='choice' data-effect='11'>Simply go to class.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='13'>Express your anger and frustration by bashing your head against the lockers.</div>",
				"You run out the door, but the principal was patrolling the sidewalk right there. Unfortunately, you accidentally bump into her. She says, &ldquo;What're you doing out here? Aren't you supposed to be going to class? The bell's almost about to ring.&rdquo; <div class='choice' data-effect='11'>Explain to her that you made a mistake and promptly go to class.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='15'>Ignore her, and run onto the street to make your escape.</div>",
				"You stick your foot out in front of the girls to trip them, but they didn't fall down and walked over your foot instead. &ldquo;So long, sucker!&rdquo; they shout back at you. Just then, the bell rings. You're late for first period! <div class='choice' data-effect='16'>Fight back at the girls and call them names.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='17'>Try to trip the girls over again.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='11'>Go to class.</div>",
				"You stick a paper clip into the keyhole and try to pick the door lock. But just then, someone opens the door from the outside, the door swings inwards, and you get slammed up against the wall. You died. Sorry.",
				"You're walking down the hallway to go to class. Your classroom number is A309, which is Mrs. Harris's reading class. But you accidentally walk into room number A308, which is...the faculty-and-staff's bathroom! <div class='choice' data-effect='14'>Get out of the bathroom.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='12'>Stuff a roll of toilet paper down the toilet.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='12'>Kick the toilet a bunch of times.</div>",
				"The toilet water starts to jack up. The pipes clog, and all the toilet water spills out of the toilet. Oh, no! What do you do now? <div class='choice' data-effect='21'>Get out of the bathroom.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='22'>Get a toilet-bowl plunger and use it to block out the water.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='23'>Wait there, and hope that the water pressure will eventually cause the toilet to stop filling up.</div>",
				"You bash your head against the lockers in frustration, and you groan, &ldquo;Aww, man!&rdquo; Unfortunately, Max the bully notices you and pounces on top of you. Quick! You need to defend yourself! <div class='choice' data-effect='4'>Fight off Max.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='4'>Run away from Max.</div>",
				"As you walk out of the bathroom, a hallway patrol sees you and asks you why you were in the faculty-and-staff's restroom. What do you tell her? <div class='choice' data-effect='18'>Tell her, &ldquo;Yo, yer. I was just, ya see, bro, yup. So, yo get it? I did. Pus!&rdquo;</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='19'>Tell her, &ldquo;I just accidentally went in there. No big deal. I was on my way to class.&rdquo;</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='18'>Tell her, &ldquo;Doo, why don'cha? I got'cha! Jus' hit cho!&rdquo;</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='20'>Make up a story, &ldquo;Oh, that? Mr. Bittner told me to go in there because I'm a bathroom cleaner for student council. Really. Yeah.&rdquo;</div>",
				"You run past the principal, onto the street. But, that street was Interstate 10, right in the middle of a traffic jam. The cars suddenly started moving again, but you weren't expecting that. You died.",
				"&ldquo;Y'all stink!&rdquo; you shout at the girls. One of the girls, named Elizabeth, turns around and walks up to you. She says, &ldquo;Hey genius, why don't you get a load of this?&rdquo; She holds up her arm and sticks her armpit up at your nose. Ironically, it stinks, just like as when you called her names. But, it stank so much that you died.",
				"You catch up to the group of girls and stick your foot out under them to trip them. But none of them tripped over, because they knew you were going to do that. After a while, they sneaked up on you and tripped you over. You got humiliated! What do you do? <div class='choice' data-effect='16'>Call the girls names.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='11'>Just go to class.</div>",
				"She punches you in the face. She retorts, &ldquo;Ha! That should teach you a lesson. Never talk slang to a hallway patrol.&rdquo; Um...but you died.",
				"&ldquo;Oh, okay,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;That's no big deal at all. It happens all the time. You can go to class now.&rdquo; <div class='choice' data-effect='25'>Go to class.</div>",
				"&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I think we'll have to check on that. Come with me, and I'll talk to Mr. Bittner. I'll write you up a tardy pass.&rdquo; <div class='choice' data-effect='27'>Go with her.</div>",
				"You got out of the bathroom, but toilet water started to spill out into the hallways. <div class='choice' data-effect='22'>Try to solve the problem by using the custodian's cleaning equipment.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='25'>Leave it alone and go to class.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='26'>Tell an adult about the toilet spillage.</div>",
				"You run out of the bathroom, quickly dart down the hallway, and get to the custodian's room where the bathroom-cleaning equipment is located. But the custodian's room is locked. What do you do? <div class='choice' data-effect='24'>Pick the lock with a paper clip.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='25'>Give up and go to class.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='26'>Tell an adult about the toilet incident.</div>",
				"You wait...and wait...and wait. But suddenly, the toilet explodes for no reason and water shoots out of the pipes. You need to make a quick escape! You try to swim your way out of the flooded bathroom, but too bad because you didn't make it. You died.",
				"You get a paper clip out of your backpack and stick it into the keyhole. Surprisingly, the door opened by itself as you picked the lock. But it wasn't because you hacked into the door-lock, it was because the custodian was inside the room, and he opened the door. You got caught! How can you explain this?",
				"You went to class. Mrs. Harris wasn't here today. Instead, there was a really old substitute teacher with wrinkles and gray hair. She talked really slowly. &ldquo;Wee'eerre gooooiiinnnggg toooo reeeeeed aan aaaarticllle abooouut theeee iccceee ageeee,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;aaaaaannnnddd lleeeeeaaaarrrnnn abbouuut pprrrooonnnounssss.&rdquo; In fact, class went by so slow, that you were so bored that you actually had to go to the bathroom. What do you do? <div class='choice' data-effect='30'>Ask to go to the bathroom.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='31'>Hold it in.</div>",
				"You told the principal about what happened in the bathroom, but he kept asking you questions about how it happened. Soon, you have no way out of this. The principal suspends you for messing around with the toilet. If you get suspended, you lose the game.",
				"The hallway patrol asks you to go to Mr. Bittner's room, which is number A201. But when you get there, you realize that Mr. Bittner is a Language Arts teacher. The hallway patrol now knows that you made up a story about the incident. You need to make a run for it, or else you'll get in trouble! <div class='choice' data-effect='28'>Run away.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='29'>Do nothing, and get in trouble.</div>",
				"You run down the hallway at top speed, and the hallway patrol chases after you. You accidentally run into Max the bully though. He punches you in the face, and you fall backwards in front of the hallway patrol. The hallway partol kicks your face. You died.",
				"You got in trouble, so you lose the game.",
				"&ldquo;Can I go to the bathroom?&rdquo; you ask the substitute. She replies, &ldquo;I don't know, can you?&rdquo; <div class='choice' data-effect='32'>Reply, &ldquo;The last time I checked, I could.&rdquo;</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='33'>Reply, &ldquo;Yes, I can.&rdquo;</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='34'>Reply, &ldquo;I mean, may I go to the restroom?&rdquo;</div>",
				"You decide to hold it. After a few minutes, you feel that you really do need to go pee. What do you do now? <div class='choice' data-effect='30'>Ask to go to the bathroom.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='35'>Keep holding it in.</div>",
				"The substitute gave you a detention slip for saying that, because apparrently, you can't crack jokes like that in front of the teacher. And you lose this game, because you got detention.",
				"The substitute says, &ldquo;Of course I knew you could.&rdquo; Then she continues the lecture without giving you permission to go to the bathroom. But you really need to use the bathroom! What do you do? <div class='choice' data-effect='36'>Ask to go again.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='37'>Just go to the bathroom without asking again.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='35'>Keep holding it in.</div>",
				"The substitute says, &ldquo;Yes, you may.&rdquo; Then you exit the classroom to go to the bathroom. On the way there, you encounter Max the bully. Dang it! You need to act fast! <div class='choice' data-effect='38'>Run past him all the way to the bathroom.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='4'>Punch and kick him out of the way.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='39'>Find a smart way to trick him.</div>",
				"You can't hold it in much longer. Pee blasts out between your legs and you shoot upwards like a rocket. Some of the students laugh, and some of the students groan, &ldquo;Eww.&rdquo; But the thing is, you fell down and you landed on your butt, which killed you.",
				"You ask the substitute again. She says, &ldquo;Hey, can't you see we're in the middle of a lecture? You've already asked twice! Sit down and start taking notes.&rdquo; <div class='choice' data-effect='35'>Continue your classwork without going to the bathroom.</div>",
				"You get up and exit the classroom without permission. The substitute runs after you as she shouts, &ldquo;Where're you going? Get back here now!&rdquo; Soon, you two get into a high-speed chase. You keep running and running. You glance behind you to see how far ahead of the substitute teacher you are, but you crash into a wall and you die.",
				"You dash right past Max. Max chases after you, but you make it into the bathroom in time. Max goes inside the bathroom to attack you, but you were hiding in the stall so he just left since he couldn't see you. <div class='choice' data-effect='40'>Get out of the bathroom once you're done peeing.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='41'>Stuff a roll of toilet paper down the toilet.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='42'>Stick your hand down the toilet and use your pee-covered hand to get revenge on Max.</div>",
				"You try to trick Max by making funny faces and running away once he gets distracted. Unfortunately, you just can't hold it any longer. As you make a silly hippo face, pee blasts out between your legs and you shoot upwards at the ceiling. You hit your head on the ceiling, and you land straight on your butt. Max starts laughing hysterically. The good news is, you have an extra pair of pants in your locker. Do you want to get them? <div class='choice' data-effect='43'>Yes.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='44'>No.</div>",
				"You wash your hands and get out of the bathroom, but guess what? Max was right outside the bathroom door, and he punched you. You died.",
				"You open up the toilet paper dispenser, but the toilet paper was fastened on a metal cylinder that was screwed into the back of the dispenser. <div class='choice' data-effect='40'>Give up, and get out of the bathroom.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='45'>Rip the roll of toilet paper out of the dispenser with brute force.</div>",
				"You stick your bare left hand down into the toilet. You want to wipe your hand, which is covered with toilet water, on Max's clothes to get revenge on him. But before you could pull your hand out of the toilet, the toilet starts flushing. Now your arm is stuck all the way into the toilet. You need some help. <div class='choice' data-effect='48'>Call for help.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='49'>Pull really hard and get your arm out.</div>",
				"You run to your locker, dial the combination, open the locker door, and...the extra pair of pants aren't there. Max walks up behind you and teases, &ldquo;You're looking for your pants?&rdquo; You turn around and see that Max actually has your pants. &ldquo;Come and get it then!&rdquo; he says as he throws the pants all the way across the hallway. <div class='choice' data-effect='46'>Go get the pants across the hallway.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='47'>Don't fetch the pants, and stand up to Max instead.</div>",
				"You go back to class without getting an extra pair of pants. As soon as you open the classroom door, students laugh and point because you have a pee stain. The substitute tells you that you have to go get a new pair of pants from your locker. <div class='choice' data-effect='43'>Go get the new pants.</div>",
				"You pull on the toilet paper roll as hard as you can. It doesn't budge. You lean backwards and give it a second try. It didn't budge. Would you like to keep trying? <div class='choice' data-effect='40'>No, and go to class.</div> <div class='choice' data-effect='50'>Yes, and try harder.</div>",
				"You run across the hallway, and you grab the pants. Now that you have the pants, you need to put them on. You can't change in the hallway, so you just wear those pants over the pants that you peed on. Just then, the second-period bell rings. Max was still teasing you, but a classroom door opened in his face and swarms of students ran out and trapped Max inside a crowd. Ha! What great luck! <div class='choice' data-effect='51'>Continue to second period.</div>",
				"&ldquo;You suck!&rdquo; you shout at Max. Max starts laughing. &ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You're so weak! Why don't you get a taste of my fist?&rdquo; He punches you in the face, and you died.",
				"&ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; you shout. For a moment, nothing happens. Then, Max storms into the restroom. &ldquo;Hey, sucker!&rdquo; he teases. &ldquo;Stuck in the toilet? Too bad, sucker!&rdquo; He runs out of the bathroom laughing. <div class='choice' data-effect='49'>Pull really hard and try to get your arm out of the toilet without any help.</div>",
				"You pull as hard as you can. Finally! Your arm pops out of the toilet. Just then, the bell rings. Wouldn't you rather go to class than get into another toilet-related mess? <div class='choice' data-effect='51'>Continue to second period.</div>",
				"You pull even harder to get the roll of toilet paper out. The toilet paper roll finally pops out, but you accidentally hit your head on the side of the stall. You died.",
				"Congratulations! You made it through &ldquo;Middle School: First Period!&rdquo;",
				"Welcome to the first book in the &ldquo;Middle School Adventures&rdquo; series. These books aren't like normal books, because you get to decide what you want to do in the book.
